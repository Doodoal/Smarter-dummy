Written using the [official Battlesnake starter template](https://replit.com/@Battlesnake/starter-snake-python?v=1) as a base.
Unlike the original, this snake is able to:
- Avoid walls
- Avoid colluding with itself
- Avoid colluding with other snakes

>Still needs to learn to find food
>Would be great for it to learn not to trap itself

Overall, that's a pretty basic snake :)
